          Albuquerque Pinho and Co is a collaborative architecture and design
          studio founded in 2020 by Luís Albuquerque Pinho. Based in Porto, the
          studio works across the fields of architecture, object design,
          wellbeing, critical thinking, and aesthetics, performing nationally
          and internationally. Its multidisciplinary practice embraces design as
          a cultural and ethical act — shaping not only the physical space, but
          also the relational spheres and ecological landscapes.

          Beyond architectural practice, APco embraces an expanded practice,
          collaborating across disciplines and media, reflecting the studio’s
          commitment to cultural engagement and experimentation, pushing
          architecture’s boundaries into art, public space, and collective
          memory.  Besides architectural work, the studio offers consulting in
          construction processes, providing technical guidance in international
          contexts.

          With a primary focus on housing, public cultural buildings and urban
          planning, the studio’s work is guided by a strong ethos of generosity
          and economy. Each project aspires to serve life and community, foster
          use and appropriation, challenging the conventional norms through
          precise yet open-ended design strategies, placing the principles of
          sustainability at the core if its designs and philosophy. Through the
          selection of materials, construction methods, and energy use, the
          studio’s work reflects a commitment to architecture’s role in shaping
          climate-conscious and regenerative futures.  APco has a growing
          interest in preserving cultural memory through contemporary design
          strategies. The preservation of cultural heritage and respect for
          traditional construction methods and craft, reinterpreting vernacular
          techniques and using local materials and labor, building for the
          future in dialogue with the past. Albuquerque Pinho and Co continues
          to evolve as a critical and creative platform, committed to developing
          architectural practices that are not only intellectually and socially
          rigorous, but also deeply responsive to the environmental challenges
          of our time.
